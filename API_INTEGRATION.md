# Novel Client API Integration

This client application has been integrated with the novel-server API to provide real character management and chat functionality.

## Setup

1. **Environment Variables**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Backend Server**
   Ensure your novel-server backend is running on `http://localhost:3000` with the following environment variables:
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

3. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

- Invalid API responses
- Character creation failures
- Chat message failures

Users receive appropriate feedback for each error type.

## Development Notes

- The app uses React hooks for state management
- TypeScript is used throughout for type safety
- API responses are properly typed
- Error boundaries protect the UI from crashes
- Streaming is implemented for better UX during long responses
